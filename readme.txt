Guide to running the program:

1 Obtain an openAI API key
2 Insert said key as an environmental variable under the name GPT_API_KEY within Intellij->Run->Edit Configurations menu
3 Run the backend
4 Open the frontpage.html of the frontend
run the GandalfGPTApplication not the Data22AIPRojectFile. 
We hope you enjoy the program

Reason why you need to use your own API key, is that chatGPTAPI will delete any key that is used by a different IP adress than the original owner
